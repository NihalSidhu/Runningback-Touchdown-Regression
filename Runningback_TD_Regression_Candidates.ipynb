        "As we have seen when watching an NFL game, a touchdown is extremely valuable. Similarly, in fantasy football touchdowns are very important to a fantasy team's success. For any receiving or rushing touchdown, a player will receive 6 points and for any touchdown thrown a quarterback will receive 4 points. This allows for touchdowns to cause massive swings in a fantasy football matchup, where a few touchdowns here and there can decide a week. However, when we watch an NFL game, we see many touchdowns, but we also see many scenarios where a player might get really close to a touchdown. Sometimes we might see our fantasy player get close to the endzone, only for our opponent's player to score. One the other hand, we sometimes see a runningback punch it in from the 1 yard line or a runningback breaking multiple tackles on their way to a 60 rushing yard touchdown!"

        "There are so many different outcomes for any running play and any one play can have a significant impact on our fantasy team. No matter how runningbacks score, it would be fantastic to know which runningbacks might be scoring more or less touchdowns in the 2023 season. We would then be able to draft players with a likelihood to score more touchdowns and avoid those who we expect to score less. This ultimately led me to focus on an overarching question which is: **Is there a way to identify who might score more or less touchdowns in the 2023 NFL season?** Luckily there is a way and it involves regressions."

        "\n",
        "We will look into play by play data from the last 10 years to understand the probability of a RB scoring a touchdown given the number of yards they are away from the endzone. Given these probabilities, we can then apply it to the 2022 RB data. With the probabilities and the 2022 data, we can see each RB's rush attempt from which yard line and see what is the probability of scoring from each rushing attempt. Then we can add up all these probabilities based on the rush attempts to define each players' expected rushing TD values. We can then compare the expected rushing TD values in 2022 versus their actual touchdown data to see who overperformed or underperformed their touchdown total given their quality and quantity of usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this information, we will be able to identify what actual touchdown total each runningback is expected to \"regress\" to in 2023, whether that means more or less touchdowns. For example, if player A scored 8 touchdowns but they were expected to score 12 in 2022, we can expect them to regress to their expected in 2023 and score more touchdowns. Similary, regressing to their average can mean a bad thing as well, where player B scored 10 touchdowns in 2022 but was only expected to score 7, which means they might regress to their expected value in 2023 and score less touchdowns.\n",

        "By leveraging the play by play data, touchdown probabilities and 2022 performances, we will be able to identify the expected touchdown totals and identify which runningbacks might regress to greater or worse touchdown totals in 2023. This will hopefully help us identify those who will score more touchdowns in 2023 and target those players in fantasy football leagues."

This chart makes sense because as you go further away from the endzone (increase in yardline_100), there is a lesser chance of scoring a touchdown. It seems that there is only about a 10% or higher probability of scoring a touchdown when you are within 10 yards of the endzone. Otheriwse, the probability of scoring a touchdown is low. So for the sake of our analysis, it might be worth finding players who get a lot of rushes within 10 yards of the endzone."

        "Looking at the highest negative regression scores table, we can see a few players managed to outperform their 2022 expectations. Some of these players include Austin Ekeler, Derrick Henry and Tony Pollard. These runningbacks were able to consistently outperform their touchdown expectations, indicating that they were often scoring in unlikely scenarios. This would indicate that these players are rather talented, showing to us that we should aim to draft them in 2023. Since they have the ability to outperform their touchdown expectations in 2022, we can make the assumption that they will score quite a few touchdowns in 2023, irregardless of their expected touchdown totals. As we had mentioned earlier, touchdowns means more fantasy points, so these players are great options to draft."

        "On the other hand, it is important to also account for the number of expected touchdowns these players had. Ekeler, Henry and Pollard were all able to outperform their expectations, but they also had rather high expected touchdown totals. Players that outperformed their low expected touchdown totals (like Mattison and Murray) are ones we might want to avoid. These players often didn't get the high value rushes in the game to score touchdowns in 2022 and there is no indication that they might get higher expected touchdowns in 2022. So players like Mattison and Murray may be 'fool's gold' where they seem like players who score a lot of touchdowns and are talented, but they don't get enough opportunity to score. Hence, we should avoid players with low expected touchdowns in 2022, even if they overperformed."

We can now use this information for the 2023 season to help us identify runningbacks that might score more touchdowns in 2023 or runningbacks that are simply good player that might continue to overperform their expected touchdowns.
